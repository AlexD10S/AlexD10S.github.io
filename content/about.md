I'm **Alex Bean**, a Software Engineer originally from Spain but in the last year I have lived in Barcelona, Dublin and Brussels. 

My main focus on **Blockchain**, more specifically **Polkadot** where I have been contributing the last year with [code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/commits/master?author=alexd10s), [examples](https://github.com/AlexD10S/substrate-betting), [dapps](https://github.com/SubstrateChess/chess-substrate-dapp), [technical support](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/users/2762/alex-bean) ... 
I like to code using Rust and Typescript, and write Smart Contracts with ink! and Solidity.
I love to learn new stuffs, especially last trendings in the Polkadot ecosystem or other concepts like **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**, **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **NFTs**...

I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Blockchain Technologies from [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en) on October 2021. I have been working as a full stack developer in different startups in the Blockchain ecosystem since 2017-2018. Currently, I am working full-time as a **Support Polkadot Engineer** at [Parity](https://www.parity.io/).

The last year I have participate in different Hackathons as a mentor in the [ETH Dublin Hackthon](https://www.ethdublin.io/), as a judge in the [Polkadot Hackathon LATAM](https://polkadothackathonlatam.com/#jueces) and having talks and workshops in the[Polkadot Metaverse](https://metaversechampionship.gg/) and the [ETH Rome Hackathon] (https://lu.ma/p3v87fab).
