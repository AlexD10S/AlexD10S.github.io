I'm **Alex Bean**, a Software Engineer originally from Spain but in the last year I have lived in Barcelona, Dublin and Brussels. 

My main focus on **Blockchain**, more specifically **Polkadot**. 
I like to code using Rust and Typescript, and write Smart Contracts with ink! and Solidity.
I love to learn new stuffs, especially last trendings in the Polkadot ecosystem or other concepts like **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **NFTs**, **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**...

I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Blockchain Technologies from [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en) on October 2021. I have been working as a full stack developer in different startups in the Blockchain ecosystem since 2017-2018. Currently, I am working full-time as a **Support Polkadot Engineer** at [Parity](https://www.parity.io/).

The last year I have participate in different Hackathons as a mentor in the [Polkadot
Metaverse](https://metaversechampionship.gg/) and [ETH Dublin Hackthon](https://www.ethdublin.io/) and as a judge in the [Polkadot Hackathon LATAM](https://polkadothackathonlatam.com/#jueces).
